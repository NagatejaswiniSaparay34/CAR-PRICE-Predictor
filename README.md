🚗 PriceMyCar - Car Price Prediction Tool

PriceMyCar is a machine learning-based car price prediction tool that estimates the resale value of a car based on key features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and more. This project leverages powerful machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price predictions, helping users make informed decisions when buying or selling cars.

🧠 ML Workflow :

Data Collection     –  The dataset contains car-related features and their prices.

Data Preprocessing  – Cleaning missing values, handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model Training      – Training multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict car prices.

Model Evaluation    – Evaluation metrics like R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess model performance.

Price Prediction    – Using the trained model to predict car prices based on user inputs.

🚀 How to Run :

To run the PriceMyCar notebook in Google Colab:

Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload your dataset (e.g., car_data.csv).

Run the notebook cells sequentially:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Train the model

Evaluate model performance

Make predictions based on user input

Example Usage :

Here's a sample code snippet to predict a car's price using a trained model:

python
Copy
Edit
# Example car data input
input_data = {
    'Year': 2018,
    'Present_Price': 7.5
    'Kms_Driven': 35000,
    'Fuel_Type': 'Petrol',
    'Seller_Type': 'Dealer',
    'Transmission': 'Manual',
    'Owner': 0
}

import pandas as pd

input_df = pd.DataFrame([input_data])

# Assuming the model and preprocessor are loaded

predicted_price = model.predict(preprocessor.transform(input_df))

print(f"Estimated Car Price: ₹{predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")

📊 Model Performance (Example) :

Metric	Value

R² Score	0.89

MAE	₹55,000

RMSE	₹68,000

Note: Performance metrics may vary depending on the dataset and model tuning.
